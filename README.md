# CIFAR10 Classification System

This project is aimed at building a convolutional neural network (CNN) system to solve a multi-class recognition problem using the CIFAR10 dataset. The system is written in Python and can be run in any Python environment. 

## CIFAR10 Dataset

The [CIFAR10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. The classes are mutually exclusive, and the dataset is divided into five training batches and one test batch. 

The classes in the CIFAR10 dataset are as follows:

1. airplane
2. automobile
3. bird
4. cat
5. deer
6. dog
7. frog
8. horse
9. ship
10. truck

## Installation

1. Clone the project from GitHub:
2. Install the required packages:

## Usage

1. Run the Python script `cifar10_classification_system.py`.

2. Follow the instructions in the script to build and improve the system.

## Acknowledgments

This project was inspired by the [PyTorch CIFAR10 tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html).
